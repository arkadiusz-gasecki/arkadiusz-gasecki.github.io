	First inspiration for this site came from tasks from Google Kickstart competition. I have found there few algorithms mentioned, which I did not know before. Moreover, I could not find any source that described in detail how they work. Hence I decided to find and describe some less popular algorithms and provided detailed explanation of them. I tried to be as detailed as possible, neverthless some basic mathematical knowledge is still needed in order to unserstand my descriptions. Apart from explaining algorithms I also provided here some other specifications, as you may notice in menu on the left. Hence title - Not Only Algorithms.<br/><br/>
	Apart from that, I decided to use the opportunity to achieve an additional goal - namely learn how to use LateX. All descriptions that you will find, were originally done in LateX. Therefore in section <i>Others</i> you will find these descriptions available to download as PDF. One thing, which is worth to underline, I did not use any converter to HTML but rewrote everything by myself. To convert mathematical equations, I have used <a href="https://www.mathjax.org">MathJax</a> library, which is mentioned at bottom of each description.
