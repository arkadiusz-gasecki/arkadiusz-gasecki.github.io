<h3>Hash tree</h3>

Structure that is worth to mentioned is Merkle tree, also known as hash tree. It is very important to underline that this concept was invented and patented in 1979 by Ralph Merkle.
I will not provide here detailed description as it is given proper enough in Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree</a>.<br/>
Neverthless, why this tree is so important? Well, nowadays we are flooded with informations about bitcoin and blockchain technology. It is simply worth to know that general concept is not new, nor revolutionary.
As you can check, it was alredy given more than 40 years ago.
