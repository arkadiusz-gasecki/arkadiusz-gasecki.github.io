	<h3>Dynamic programming </h3>
	<p>
		Dynamic programming isn't an algorithm by itself. This is rather technique that can be applied in different algorithms in order to increase their efficiency. Mostly it is applied in situations, where classic "brute force" approach is optimized. This technique relies on saving intermediate results, so same calculations do not have to be performed several times. Therefore, additional memory is nedeed. It is important to underline that each algorithm, which uses this technique, is different and specific for solving particular problem. Here we will present this technique on very common knapsack problem as well as on solutions of two problems, given in Google Kickstart competition.
