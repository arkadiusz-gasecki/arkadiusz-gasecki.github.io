	Below is base description of my Github repository. All codes are in Python and base purpose for writing all of them was to learn how to use this programming language.
	<table class="github">
		<tr>
			<td>codejam</td>
			<td>Here I have placed solutions to some problems published in qualification round of Google Codejam 2020. I did not participate in context, just afterwards I did write some solution only to check, how I would perform.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>datacenter</td>
			<td>Here I have put my solution for problem of 2015 Google Hashcode qualification round, done for training.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>drones</td>
			<td>Similarly as above, but here it's problem from 2016. Here it was first problem, where I tried to use Python to build a simple simulation.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>kickstart</td>
			<td>Here I am placing codes for problems from Google Kickstart - most of them were done afterwards, some of them I have implemented during competition time.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>latex</td>
			<td>Here you can find template for LateX document with all basic components - paragraphs, enumerations, itemizations, tables, few nice pictures, etc.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>standard_algorithms</td>
			<td>Here I have put Python implementations of some standard problems, including few that are described in <i>Algorithms</i> section.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>julia</td>
			<td>Here I am successfully placing copies of codes from other folders, but written in Julia programming language, which I want to explore.</td>
		</tr>
