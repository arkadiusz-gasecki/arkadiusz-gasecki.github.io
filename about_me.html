<h2>About me</h2>
		<p class="main">
			<img id="mypic" src="images/mypic2.jpg" />Hi, I am Arek. I am proud graduate from Military University of Technology in Warsaw, Poland. I have successfully obtained there my PhD degree, but I have to admit it was done more as a hobby. Professionally, I am involved in data processing from the very beginning of my carrier. Currently I am living and working in Zurich Metropolitan Area. Introvert, with no fascinating hobbies.<br/><br/>
			On this website I want to share my latest activities, done mostly in order to learn something new. Currently, it is not adjusted to mobile devices :(
